# Criterion

Criterion helps manager of the organization to made a decision under uncertainty environment. To take the optimal decision in environment where it's not possible to assess probabilities of certain outcomes.

The examples problem that Criterion can help include capacity planning, location planning, production and service design, equipment selection, etc.

## Decision Theory
Criterion use the following approach to choose the optimal decision.

### Laplace Criterion
The Laplace Criterion assume that the probability of all possible outcomes is equal. This criterion is based on [Principle of Insufficient Reason](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_indifference).

### Wald's Maximin Model
Wald's Maximin Model choose the optimal decision according to which decisions are ranked on the basis of their worst-case outcomes.

### Savage's Minimax Regret
[The minimax regret](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regret_%28decision_theory%29#Minimax_regret) approach is to minimize the worst-case regret.

### Hurwicz'c Criterion
Hurwicz's criterion gives each decision a value which is "a weighted sum of its worst and best possible outcomes" represented as Î± and known as an index of pessimism or optimism.
